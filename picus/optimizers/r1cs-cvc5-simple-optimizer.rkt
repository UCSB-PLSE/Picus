; this contains a list of simple and basic optimization steps
;   - add p related definition and replace p
;   - remove *1 in mul
;   - remove +0 in add
;   - rewrite *x as x
;   - rewrite -x as -x
;   - rewrite +x as x
;   - replace x0 with 1
;   - partial evaluation: compute concrete results, e.g., 0*0 => 0
;     - (fixme) current only modify 0*...*x to 0
